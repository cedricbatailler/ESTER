## Installation

The `itER` package is not on CRAN yet, but you can install the development version from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("lnalborczyk/itER")
```

## Different questions

1. Does the ER computed on my observed sample reached a stable region ?
2. How common is the observed evolution of this ER, considering random permutation and / or bootstrapped samples ?
3. If an a priori ER threshold has been fixed, what to do when this threshold is fixed ? How to be *sure* that it is not due to random variation ?

## Development

The *itER* package is also available in a development version at the GitHub development page: [https://github.com/lnalborczyk/itER](https://github.com/lnalborczyk/itER).
